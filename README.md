# Pitch-detector
GUI Pitch detector for audio file and live input   
Switching to some audio drivers, including the "disk" driver can break the audio system, so please use a known driver, and restart the software if there is audio input or output issues after switching the driver.   
While this is developed mainly on Mac OS, it should be able to be compiled on any platform supported by libsdl2 including Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and Emscripten.
